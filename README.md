# Shell_Principles

Project Title: Shell Principles

Language: C++

Description: The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how the shell commands work. Using C++ code, I made functions that, when called, will execute the specific shell command. This was a pretty straightforward project, and the only problem that I had to deal with was deciding which language to use. I am currently learning Python and GDscript and was thinking of using Python, but I went ahead and used C++ instead. Some things I learned were how to guide a program to make it more user-friendly, while maintaining the integrity of the project. 

When you download the project, you can run it on basically any IDE. Many popular ones are Visual Studio, Visual Studio code, Online IDE, and Online GDB. When the code is running, the instructions are pretty clear. There will be six options that will correlate to the specific shell command, which will then execute the command.
